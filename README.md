## Overview
During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on various web development projects that involved building responsive user interfaces, 
implementing interactive features, and integrating APIs. These projects demonstrate my hands-on experience with front-end development, 
as well as my ability to solve problems and adapt to different requirements.

## Projects
Here is a list of the primary projects completed during the internship, each showcasing different skills:

1. **Landing Page Design** - A responsive landing page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Weather App** - A JavaScript-based app that fetches weather data from a public API.
3. **To-Do List** - A ReactJS app with CRUD functionality to manage tasks.
4. **E-commerce Product Page** - A sample product page with filtering and sorting options.
5. **Portfolio Website** - A personal portfolio showcasing completed projects and skills.

> Each project is organized in its own folder, with a README file describing the specific task requirements,
> technologies used, and any relevant notes.
